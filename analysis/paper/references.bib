  abstract = {A new ENSO SST index is documented that is strongly correlated to the core ENSO phenomenon. The SST anomaly in much of the east-central and eastern tropical Pacific is closely related to ENSO. However, the anomaly from approximately the centre of the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific westward to near the date line is suggested to be most strongly ENSO-related when data spanning the most recent several decades are used. This is the case both with respect to (1) strength of association with other oceanic/atmospheric ENSO-related anomalies (both simultaneously and as a time-delayed predictand), and (2) impact on remote worldwide climate anomalies. This observational insight was lacking in the early 1980s when the four ``Ni\~no'' regions were developed. While a firmer dynamical foundation for this regional preference still needs to be established, the region straddling Ni\~no 3 and Ni\~no 4 may be regarded as an appropriate general SST index of the ENSO state by researchers, diagnosticians and forecasters. A dataset of this index, called ``Ni\~no 3.4'' (5\textdegree N-5\textdegree S, 120\textendash 170\textdegree W), is maintained on the Internet, shown in the Climate Diagnostics Bulletin, and provided in the Appendix of this note.},

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses \textemdash{} the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The climate of South America (SA) has long held an intimate connection with El Ni\~no, historically describing anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures off the coastline of Peru. Indeed, throughout SA, precipitation and temperature exhibit a substantial, yet regionally diverse, relationship with the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, El Ni\~no is typically accompanied by drought in the Amazon and north-eastern SA, but flooding in the tropical west coast and south-eastern SA, with marked socio-economic effects. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of ENSO teleconnections to SA. Recent efforts have sought improved understanding of ocean\textendash atmosphere processes that govern the impact, inter-event and decadal variability, and responses to anthropogenic warming. ENSO's impacts have been found to vary markedly, affected not only by ENSO diversity, but also by modes of variability within and outside of the Pacific. However, while the understanding of ENSO\textendash SA relationships has improved, with implications for prediction and projection, uncertainty remains in regards to the robustness of the impacts, inter-basin climate interactions and interplay with greenhouse warming. A coordinated international effort is, therefore, needed to close the observational, theoretical and modelling gaps currently limiting progress, with specific efforts in extending palaeoclimate proxies further back in time, reducing systematic model errors and improving simulations of ENSO diversity and teleconnections.},

Combinations of simple progressive and standing oscillations are used to examine the properties of this technique. These examples illustrate that although CPC analysis allows for the identification of traveling waves, many of the drawbacks associated with conventional principal component analysis remain, and sometimes become worse; e.g. the interpretation of CPC solutions is more difficult since both amplitude and phase relationships must be considered. A method for linearly transforming complex principal components was devised in order to identify regional relationships within large geophysical data sets. The errors in CPC analysis resulting from limited sample sizes are discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Pacific\textendash South American (PSA) pattern is an important mode of climate variability in the mid-to-high southern latitudes. It is widely recognized as the primary mechanism by which El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic and in recent years has also been suggested as a mechanism by which longer-term tropical sea surface temperature trends can influence the Antarctic climate. This study presents a novel methodology for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (a great circle) traces the approximate path of the pattern, the identification algorithm utilizes Fourier analysis as opposed to a traditional empirical orthogonal function approach. The climatology arising from the application of this method to ERA-Interim reanalysis data reveals that the PSA pattern has a strong influence on temperature and precipitation variability over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula and on sea ice variability in the adjacent Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas. Identified seasonal trends toward the negative phase of the PSA pattern are consistent with warming observed over the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn, but are inconsistent with observed winter warming over West Antarctica. Only a weak relationship is identified between the PSA pattern and ENSO, which suggests that the pattern might be better conceptualized as a preferred regional atmospheric response to various external (and internal) forcings.},

  abstract = {There are two pervasive modes of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) that influence circulation and rainfall anomalies over South America. They appear as leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of 500-hPa height or 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies and are found from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. Both patterns exhibit wave 3 hemispheric patterns in mid to high latitudes, and a well-defined wave train with large amplitude in the Pacific\textendash South American (PSA) sector. Therefore, they are referred to as the PSA modes (PSA1 and PSA2). PSA1 is related to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the central and eastern Pacific at decadal scales, and it is the response to El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the interannual band. The associated rainfall summer pattern shows rainfall deficits over northeastern Brazil and enhanced rainfall over southeastern South America similar to rainfall anomalies during ENSO. PSA2 is associated with the quasi-biennial component of ENSO, with a period of 22\textendash 28 months and the strongest connections occur during the austral spring. The associated rainfall pattern shows a dipole pattern with anomalies out of phase between the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) extending from central South America into the Atlantic and the subtropical plains centred at 35\textdegree S. These two modes are also apparent in tropical intraseasonal oscillations for both summer and winter. Eastward propagation of enhanced convection from the Indian Ocean through the western Pacific to the central Pacific is accompanied by a wave train that appears to originate in the convective regions. The positive PSA1 pattern is associated with enhanced convection over the Pacific from 150\textdegree E to the date line. The convection pattern associated with PSA2 is in quadrature with that of PSA1. Both PSA modes are influenced by the Madden Julian Oscillation and influence rainfall over South America.

  abstract = {Hemispheric maps of monthly mean total ozone display distinct waves of low zonal wavenumbers during winter months. In addition, there is a strong and statistically significant spatial correlation between the total ozone perturbation and the temperature perturbation in the lower stratosphere. Previous attempts at an explanation of the correlation appear somewhat unsatisfactory. In the current paper the climatological behavior for southern hemisphere October is investigated. Specifying the dynamics from observations in the linearized stationary ozone continuity equation, one can simulate the lowest wavenumbers of the hemispheric total ozone perturbation. Both vertical and horizontal advection substantially contribute to the total ozone perturbation, with significantly different patterns each. A conceptual picture for the correlation is developed, which accounts for both advection contributions. The slopes of lower stratospheric zonal mean potential temperature and ozone mixing ratio turn out to be important. Furthermore, the feasibility of a Matsuno-type model for the waves in total ozone is shown.},
