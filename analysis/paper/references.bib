  abstract = {Assessing stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling in observational data or model output requires a multi-level index with high time resolution. Ideally, such an index would (1) represent spatial patterns in the troposphere that are most strongly coupled with stratospheric variability and (2) be robust and computationally feasible in both observations and standard model output. Several of the indices used to diagnose extratropical stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling are based on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere annular modes. The annular mode indices are commonly defined as the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of monthly-mean, hemispheric geopotential height. In the lowermost troposphere, the structure of the annular modes is defined as the leading EOF of the near-surface geopotential height field, and these patterns correspond well to the patterns of variability induced by stratospheric circulation changes. At pressure levels above the surface, the structure of the annular modes is typically found by either calculating the local EOF or regressing geopotential height data onto the leading principal component time series of near-surface geopotential height. Here we make a critical comparison of the existing methodologies used to diagnose stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling, including EOF-based indices as well as measures based on zonal-mean wind at a fixed latitude and geopotential height over the polar cap. We argue in favour of an alternative methodology based on EOFs of daily zonally-averaged geopotential. We find that (1) the daily evolution of stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling events is seen most clearly with this methodology, and (2) the methodology is robust and requires few subjective choices, making it readily applicable to climate model output available only in zonal-mean form.

  abstract = {A new ENSO SST index is documented that is strongly correlated to the core ENSO phenomenon. The SST anomaly in much of the east-central and eastern tropical Pacific is closely related to ENSO. However, the anomaly from approximately the centre of the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific westward to near the date line is suggested to be most strongly ENSO-related when data spanning the most recent several decades are used. This is the case both with respect to (1) strength of association with other oceanic/atmospheric ENSO-related anomalies (both simultaneously and as a time-delayed predictand), and (2) impact on remote worldwide climate anomalies. This observational insight was lacking in the early 1980s when the four ``Ni\~no'' regions were developed. While a firmer dynamical foundation for this regional preference still needs to be established, the region straddling Ni\~no 3 and Ni\~no 4 may be regarded as an appropriate general SST index of the ENSO state by researchers, diagnosticians and forecasters. A dataset of this index, called ``Ni\~no 3.4'' (5\textdegree N-5\textdegree S, 120\textendash 170\textdegree W), is maintained on the Internet, shown in the Climate Diagnostics Bulletin, and provided in the Appendix of this note.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power.

  abstract = {Abstract Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are large, rapid temperature rises in the winter polar stratosphere, occurring predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Major SSWs are also associated with a reversal of the climatological westerly zonal-mean zonal winds. Circulation anomalies associated with SSWs can descend into the troposphere with substantial surface weather impacts, such as wintertime extreme cold air outbreaks. After their discovery in 1952, SSWs were classified by the World Meteorological Organization. An examination of literature suggests that a single, original reference for an exact definition of SSWs is elusive, but in many references a definition involves the reversal of the meridional temperature gradient and, for major warmings, the reversal of the zonal circulation poleward of 60\textdegree{} latitude at 10 hPa. Though versions of this definition are still commonly used to detect SSWs, the details of the definition and its implementation remain ambiguous. In addition, other SSW definitions have been used in the last few decades, resulting in inconsistent classification of SSW events. We seek to answer the questions: How has the SSW definition changed, and how sensitive is the detection of SSWs to the definition used? For what kind of analysis is a ``standard'' definition useful? We argue that a standard SSW definition is necessary for maintaining a consistent and robust metric to assess polar stratospheric wintertime variability in climate models and other statistical applications. To provide a basis for, and to encourage participation in, a communitywide discussion currently underway, we explore what criteria are important for a standard definition and propose possible ways to update the definition.},

Modes of variability in the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) field of the following three experiments are examined: 1) a coupled experiment, in which the atmosphere and the ocean are fully coupled, producing El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles and allowing full air\textendash sea interactions; 2) a mixed layer experiment, in which the atmosphere is coupled to an ocean mixed layer heat equation allowing limited air\textendash sea interactions; and 3) a climatology experiment, in which the atmosphere is forced by an observed SST climatology with a fixed annual cycle, allowing no air\textendash sea interactions. It is found that the observed modes are reasonably simulated in all three experiments, although the amplitude of the model modes is generally smaller than that of the observed. These modes include the high-latitude mode (i.e., the Antarctic Oscillation), the Pacific\textendash South American (PSA) mode, and the wavenumber-3 mode. It is also found that the response of the mid- to high-latitude atmosphere circulation to the model ENSO forcing projects mainly onto the PSA mode. Many features of the PSA mode are similar to those associated with the Pacific\textendash North American mode in the Northern Hemisphere. In response to these Z500 modes, the ocean produces coherent modes of variability, but the oceanic feedback effect appears to be weak. The amplitude of anomalies associated with each mode of the Z500 field in the three experiments shows little difference, suggesting that these Z500 modes can be generated by atmospheric internal dynamics alone, and that the ocean dynamics, air\textendash sea interactions, and ENSO forcing are not essential.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Simulations of individual global climate drivers using models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3(CMIP3) have been examined; however, the relationship among them has not been assessed. This is carried out to address several important issues, including the likelihood of the southern annular mode (SAM) forcing Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events and the possible impact of the IOD on El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Several conclusions emerge from statistics based on multimodel outputs. First, ENSO signals project strongly onto the SAM, although ENSO-forced signals tend to peak before ENSO. This feature is similar to the situation associated with the IOD. The IOD-induced signal over southern Australia, through stationary equivalent Rossby barotropic wave trains, peak before the IOD itself. Second, there is no control by the SAM on the IOD, in contrast to what has been suggested previously. Indeed, no model produces a SAM\textendash IOD relationship that supports a positive (negative) SAM driving a positive (negative) IOD event. This is the case even in models that do not simulate a statistically significant relationship between ENSO and the IOD. Third, the IOD does have an impact on ENSO. The relationship between ENSO and the IOD in the majority of models is far weaker than the observed. However, the ENSO's influence on the IOD is boosted by a spurious oceanic teleconnection, whereby ENSO discharge\textendash recharge signals transmit to the Sumatra\textendash Java coast, generating thermocline anomalies and changing IOD properties. Without the spurious oceanic teleconnection, the influence of the IOD on ENSO is comparable to the impact of ENSO on the IOD. Other model deficiencies are discussed.},

  abstract = {The climate of South America (SA) has long held an intimate connection with El Ni\~no, historically describing anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures off the coastline of Peru. Indeed, throughout SA, precipitation and temperature exhibit a substantial, yet regionally diverse, relationship with the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, El Ni\~no is typically accompanied by drought in the Amazon and north-eastern SA, but flooding in the tropical west coast and south-eastern SA, with marked socio-economic effects. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of ENSO teleconnections to SA. Recent efforts have sought improved understanding of ocean\textendash atmosphere processes that govern the impact, inter-event and decadal variability, and responses to anthropogenic warming. ENSO's impacts have been found to vary markedly, affected not only by ENSO diversity, but also by modes of variability within and outside of the Pacific. However, while the understanding of ENSO\textendash SA relationships has improved, with implications for prediction and projection, uncertainty remains in regards to the robustness of the impacts, inter-basin climate interactions and interplay with greenhouse warming. A coordinated international effort is, therefore, needed to close the observational, theoretical and modelling gaps currently limiting progress, with specific efforts in extending palaeoclimate proxies further back in time, reducing systematic model errors and improving simulations of ENSO diversity and teleconnections.},

  abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical circulation and it is so called because of its zonally symmetric ring-like shape. However, the SAM pattern actually contains noticeable deviations from zonal symmetry. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the zonally asymmetric and symmetric components of the SAM variability and their impacts. We regress monthly geopotential height fields at each level onto the asymmetric and symmetric component of the SAM to create two new indices: Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) and Symmetric SAM (S-SAM). In the troposphere, the A-SAM is associated with a zonal wave 3 which is rotated a quarter wavelength with respect to the climatological zonal wave 3, is much stronger in the Pacific ocean, where it extends vertically to the stratosphere with an equivalent barotropic structure. On the other hand, the S-SAM is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica surrounded by a zonally symmetric ring of positive geopotential height anomalies. The observed relationship between the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation and the SAM is fully explained by the A-SAM index. The positive trend of the SAM is present only in its symmetric component. Despite this, the SAM is becoming more zonally asymmetric. The regional impacts of the SAM in temperature and precipitation are strongly affected by its asymmetric component. We show that the asymmetric component of the SAM has its own unique variability, trends and impacts, some of these signals are only evident when the two SAM components are separated.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) has been observed as a deep oscillation in the mid- and high southern latitudes. In the present study, the AAO pattern is defined as the leading mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF-1) obtained from daily 700-hPa geopotential height anomalies from 1979 to 2000. Here the objective is to identify daily positive and negative AAO phases and relationships with intraseasonal activity in the Tropics and phases of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the austral summer [December\textendash January\textendash February (DJF)]. Positive and negative AAO phases are defined when the daily EOF-1 time coefficient is above (or below) one standard deviation of the DJF mean. Composites of low-frequency sea surface temperature variation, 200-hPa zonal wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) indicate that negative (positive) phases of the AAO are dominant when patterns of SST, convection, and circulation anomalies resemble El Ni\~no (La Ni\~na) phases of ENSO. Enhanced intraseasonal activity from the Tropics to the extratropics of the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere is associated with negative (positive) phases of the AAO. In addition, there is indication that the onset of negative phases of the AAO is related to the propagation of the Madden\textendash Julian oscillation (MJO). Suppression of intraseasonal convective activity over Indonesia is observed in positive AAO phases. It is hypothesized that deep convection in the central tropical Pacific, which is related to either El Ni\~no or eastward-propagating MJO, or a combination of both phenomena, modulates the Southern Hemisphere circulation and favors negative AAO phases during DJF. The alternation of AAO phases seems to be linked to the latitudinal migration of the subtropical upper-level jet and variations in the intensity of the polar jet. This, in turn, affects extratropical cyclone properties, such as origin, minimum/maximum central pressure, and their equatorward propagation.},

Analysis of tropical Pacific SST anomalies is conducted separately for the central Pacific (CP) and eastern Pacific (EP) regions. During the austral cold season, extratropical SH atmospheric Rossby wave train patterns are observed in association with both EP and CP SST variability. The primary difference between the patterns is the westward displacement of the CP-related atmospheric anomalies, consistent with the westward elongation of CP-related convective SST required for upper-level divergence and Rossby wave generation. Consequently, CP-related patterns of SH SST, Antarctic sea ice, and temperature anomalies also exhibit a westward displacement, but otherwise, the cold season extratropical SH teleconnections are largely similar. During the warm season, however, extratropical SH teleconnections associated with tropical CP and EP SST anomalies differ substantially. EP SST variability is linked to largely zonally symmetric structures in the extratropical atmospheric circulation, which projects onto the southern annular mode (SAM), and is strongly related to the SH temperature and sea ice fields. In contrast, CP SST variability is only weakly related to the SH atmospheric circulation, temperature, or sea ice fields and no longer exhibits any clear association with the SAM. One hypothesized mechanism suggests that the relatively weak CP-related SST anomalies are not able to substantially impact the background flow of the subtropical jet and its subsequent interaction with equatorward-propagating waves associated with variability in the SAM. However, there is currently no widely established mechanism that links tropical Pacific SST anomalies to the SAM.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background `first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2\textdegree{} spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific\textendash North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.

  abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of extratropical Southern Hemisphere climate variability, associated with changes in the strength and position of the polar jet around Antarctica. This variability in the polar jet drives large fluctuations in the Southern Hemisphere climate, from the lower stratosphere into the troposphere, and stretching from the midlatitudes across the Southern Ocean to Antarctica. Notably, the SAM index has displayed marked positive trends in the austral summer season (stronger and poleward shifted westerlies), associated with stratospheric ozone loss. Historical reconstructions demonstrate that these recent positive SAM index values are unprecedented in the last millennia, and fall outside the range of natural climate variability. Despite these advances in the understanding of the SAM behavior, several areas of active research are identified that highlight gaps in our present knowledge.

It affects highly populated areas that are of substantial importance for the regional food supplies. Previous studies using principal components analysis or complex networks were able to describe and characterize this variability pattern, but crucial questions regarding the responsible physical mechanism remain open. Here, we use phase synchronization techniques to study the relation between precipitation in the SACZ and SESA on the one hand and southern hemisphere Rossby wave trains on the other hand. In combination with a conceptual model, this approach demonstrates that the dipolar precipitation pattern is caused by the southern hemisphere Rossby waves. Our results thus show that Rossby waves are the main driver of the monsoon season variability in South America, a finding that has important implications for synoptic-scale weather forecasts.},

Attempts have been made in the past to define an index that quantifies the variability in the ZW3 pattern; however, existing methods are based on fixed geographical locations and fail to capture certain ZW3 events because of strong variability in phase. In addition, a fixed spatial index poorly characterizes ZW3 in CMIP models, which can exhibit biases in the mean phase of the ZW3 pattern. In this study, we introduce a new way to characterize ZW3 variability by incorporating two indices, one each for magnitude and phase, based on the combination of the first two Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the 500 hPa meridional wind anomalies. We show that the new ZW3 index provides a clear advantage over past indices because it captures a substantially higher proportion of variance (\textasciitilde 40\% compared to \textasciitilde 16\%), and it can be used for both reanalysis data sets and coupled climate models regardless of model biases. A composite analysis associated with the new index reveals a strong relationship between the ZW3 defined by our index and sea-ice fraction around Antarctica, with significant regional sea-ice anomalies during strong ZW3 events with different phases.},

These equations include the effects of absorption of solar radiation by O\textsubscript{3}, temperature-dependent O\textsubscript{3} photochemistry and advection of O\textsubscript{3} by wave motions.

In this paper the month-to-month variability explained by the zonal waves 1 and 3 is examined, and an alternative representation of the SH circulation is presented based on two quasi-stationary anticyclones in the sub-Antarctic western hemisphere. These anticyclones are related to the zonal waves, but features of their variability are masked by the zonal wave decomposition; in particular, the anticyclones' strengths are not positively covariant. They are also compared with the leading Principal Components of the SH atmosphere. We show that they capture variance independent of the Southern Annular Mode. Additionally, they explain a generally greater fraction of the variability than the PSA, and in a manner that also includes information regarding spatial variability.

It has been checked that the conclusions drawn in this study are valid even if data from only the satellite era are used. The emphasis of the paper is on the winter season, but results for the four seasons are also discussed. Both upper- and lower-tropospheric fields are used. The tracking analysis focuses on systems that last longer than 2 days and are mobile (move more than 1000 km). Many of the results support previous ideas about the storm tracks, but some new insights are also obtained. In the summer there is a rather circular, strong, deep high-latitude storm track. In winter the high-latitude storm track is more asymmetric with a spiral from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in toward Antarctica and a subtropical jet\textendash related lower-latitude storm track over the Pacific, again tending to spiral poleward. At all times of the year, maximum storm activity in the higher-latitude storm track is in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. In the winter upper troposphere, the relative importance of, and interplay between, the subtropical and subpolar storm tracks is discussed. The genesis, lysis, and growth rate of lower-tropospheric winter cyclones together lead to a vivid picture of their behavior that is summarized as a set of overlapping plates, each composed of cyclone life cycles. Systems in each plate appear to feed the genesis in the next plate through downstream development in the upper-troposphere spiral storm track. In the lee of the Andes in South America, there is cyclogenesis associated with the subtropical jet and also, poleward of this, cyclogenesis largely associated with system decay on the upslope and regeneration on the downslope. The genesis and lysis of cyclones and anticyclones have a definite spatial relationship with each other and with the Andes. At 500 hPa, their relative longitudinal positions are consistent with vortex-stretching ideas for simple flow over a large-scale mountain. Cyclonic systems near Antarctica have generally spiraled in from lower latitudes. However, cyclogenesis associated with mobile cyclones occurs around the Antarctic coast with an interesting genesis maximum over the sea ice near 150\textdegree E. The South Pacific storm track emerges clearly from the tracking as a coherent deep feature spiraling from Australia to southern South America. A feature of the summer season is the genesis of eastward-moving cyclonic systems near the tropic of Capricorn off Brazil, in the central Pacific and, to a lesser extent, off Madagascar, followed by movement along the southwest flanks of the subtropical anticyclones and contribution to the ``convergence zone'' cloud bands seen in these regions.},

This update incorporates a new release of ICOADS release 3.0 (R3.0), a decade of near-surface data from Argo floats, and a new estimate of centennial sea ice from HadISST2. A number of choices in aspects of quality control, bias adjustment, and interpolation have been substantively revised. The resulting ERSST estimates have more realistic spatiotemporal variations, better representation of high-latitude SSTs, and ship SST biases are now calculated relative to more accurate buoy measurements, while the global long-term trend remains about the same. Progressive experiments have been undertaken to highlight the effects of each change in data source and analysis technique upon the final product. The reconstructed SST is systematically decreased by 0.077\textdegree C, as the reference data source is switched from ship SST in ERSSTv4 to modern buoy SST in ERSSTv5. Furthermore, high-latitude SSTs are decreased by 0.1\textdegree\textendash 0.2\textdegree C by using sea ice concentration from HadISST2 over HadISST1. Changes arising from remaining innovations are mostly important at small space and time scales, primarily having an impact where and when input observations are sparse.

  abstract = {Southern Hemisphere mid- to upper-tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterized by the superposition of two zonally oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms: zonal wavenumber 1 (ZW1) and zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of those studies relating to sea ice, little is known about their impact on regional climate variability. A novel approach is taken to quantifying the combined influence of ZW1 and ZW3, using the strength of the hemispheric meridional flow as a proxy for zonal wave activity. The methodology adapts the wave envelope construct routinely used in the identification of synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and improves on existing approaches by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude. While ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component. Composites of the mean surface conditions during these highly meridional, ZW3-like anomalous states (i.e., months of strong planetary wave activity) reveal large sea ice anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during autumn and along much of the East Antarctic coastline throughout the year. Large precipitation anomalies in regions of significant topography (e.g., New Zealand, Patagonia, and coastal Antarctica) and anomalously warm temperatures over much of the Antarctic continent were also associated with strong planetary wave activity. The latter has potentially important implications for the interpretation of recent warming over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.},

It is widely recognized as the primary mechanism by which El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic and in recent years has also been suggested as a mechanism by which longer-term tropical sea surface temperature trends can influence the Antarctic climate. This study presents a novel methodology for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (a great circle) traces the approximate path of the pattern, the identification algorithm utilizes Fourier analysis as opposed to a traditional empirical orthogonal function approach. The climatology arising from the application of this method to ERA-Interim reanalysis data reveals that the PSA pattern has a strong influence on temperature and precipitation variability over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula and on sea ice variability in the adjacent Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas. Identified seasonal trends toward the negative phase of the PSA pattern are consistent with warming observed over the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn, but are inconsistent with observed winter warming over West Antarctica. Only a weak relationship is identified between the PSA pattern and ENSO, which suggests that the pattern might be better conceptualized as a preferred regional atmospheric response to various external (and internal) forcings.},

  abstract = {Abstract Surface observations and subsurface ocean assimilation datasets are examined to contrast two distinct types of El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific: an eastern-Pacific (EP) type and a central-Pacific (CP) type. An analysis method combining empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and linear regression is used to separate these two types. Correlation and composite analyses based on the principal components of the EOF were performed to examine the structure, evolution, and teleconnection of these two ENSO types. The EP type of ENSO is found to have its SST anomaly center located in the eastern equatorial Pacific attached to the coast of South America. This type of ENSO is associated with basinwide thermocline and surface wind variations and shows a strong teleconnection with the tropical Indian Ocean. In contrast, the CP type of ENSO has most of its surface wind, SST, and subsurface anomalies confined in the central Pacific and tends to onset, develop, and decay in situ. This type of ENSO appears less related to the thermocline variations and may be influenced more by atmospheric forcing. It has a stronger teleconnection with the southern Indian Ocean. Phase-reversal signatures can be identified in the anomaly evolutions of the EP-ENSO but not for the CP-ENSO. This implies that the CP-ENSO may occur more as events or epochs than as a cycle. The EP-ENSO has experienced a stronger interdecadal change with the dominant period of its SST anomalies shifted from 2 to 4 yr near 1976/77, while the dominant period for the CP-ENSO stayed near the 2-yr band. The different onset times of these two types of ENSO imply that the difference between the EP and CP types of ENSO could be caused by the timing of the mechanisms that trigger the ENSO events.},

This problem arises when several sample correlation coefficients between climatic/oceanic time series are computed, but only the largest ones in magnitude are selected as significant. Testing a large number of hypotheses leads to a rapid increase in the probability of erroneously rejecting at least one hypothesis if the significance level of each test is kept fixed. Walker developed methods to counteract the effects of multiplicity, but this problem is still ignored in most modern studies. The effects of multiplicity are compounded for time series with autocorrelation, as is the case for most climatic variables. Monte Carlo simulations of sets of climatic time series indicate that multiplicity can be counteracted by using a modernized version of Walker's approach that includes a correction of the test statistics for the effects of autocorrelation. Overall significance levels obtained by applying other testing approaches that fail to account for either multiplicity or autocorrelation are generally much larger than the desired value.},

During the SH winter, when there exist both subtropical and polar front jets, growing baroclinic waves are found between the two jets as well as along the polar front jet. These baroclinic waves between the two jets pump westerly momentum into the interjet region flanked by the subtropical and polar front jets. As a result, these baroclinic waves blend the two jets, preventing the longtime occurrence or establishment of two well-defined jets. It is also shown that during the SH winter, the deceleration of the westerlies on the equatorward side of the subtropical jet is mostly associated with the above baroclinic waves in the interjet region, rather than with eddies that originate along the polar front jet. A set of idealized numerical model experiments shows that as the value of the surface friction is increased, the direction of the baroclinic wave momentum flux in the interjet region changes, resulting in a drastically different climatological flow.},

In this study, new insights into the observed seasonally varying signature of ENSO in the extratropical zonal-mean circulation are provided and the associated linkages with the dominant patterns of extratropical variability are examined. The zonal-mean extratropical atmospheric response to ENSO is characterized by two principal features: an equivalent barotropic dipole in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) zonal-mean zonal flow with centers of action located near {$\sim$}40\textdegree{} and {$\sim$}60\textdegree{} during austral summer, and a weaker, but analogous, dipole in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) with centers of action located near {$\sim$}25\textdegree{} and {$\sim$}45\textdegree{} during early and late boreal winter. Both structures are accompanied by eddy momentum flux anomalies that exhibit a remarkable degree of hemispheric symmetry. In the SH, the extratropical signature of ENSO projects strongly onto the primary mode of large-scale variability, the southern annular mode (SAM). During the austral summer, roughly 25\% of the temporal variability in the SAM is linearly related to fluctuations in the ENSO cycle. An analogous relationship is not observed in association with the principal mode of climate variability in the NH, the northern annular mode (NAM). It is argued that the seasonally varying impact of ENSO on the extratropical circulation is consistent with the impact of the thermally forced subtropical wind anomalies on the dissipation of equatorward-propagating wave activity at subtropical latitudes.},

SH stratosphere-troposphere coupling is explored by height-time domain empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to the zonal mean-zonal wind anomalies averaged over the Antarctic circumpolar region (55\textendash 65\textdegree S; U55\textendash 65\textdegree S). The leading EOF explains 42\% of the height-time variance of U55\textendash 65\textdegree S and depicts the variations of the vortex that is tightly tied to the seasonal breakdown of the vortex during late spring. The leading EOF pattern, defined here as the stratosphere-troposphere coupled mode, is characterized by variations in U55\textendash 65\textdegree S that develop in early winter near the stratopause, change sign from late winter to early spring, gain maximum amplitude during October in the upper stratosphere, and then extend downward to the surface from October to January. This stratosphere-troposphere coupling during the spring months appears to be preconditioned by anomalies in upward propagating planetary wave activity and a meridional shift of the vortex as high as the stratopause and as early as June. Interannual variations of the stratosphere-troposphere coupled mode are highly correlated with those of the tropospheric SAM, Antarctic stratospheric ozone concentration, Antarctic sea ice concentrations in the South Pacific and the Weddell Sea, and SH regional climate during late spring\textendash early summer. Anomalies in the upper stratospheric flow as early as June are thus a potentially important source of predictability for the tropospheric SAM and its associated impacts on surface climate in spring and summer.},

Rossby's original solution of the barotropic vorticity equation is tested for stability, using beta-plane geometry. When the waves are sufficiently strong or the wavenumber is sufficiently high, the flow is found to be unstable, but if the flow is weak or the wavenumber is low, the beta effect may render the flow stable. The amplification rate of growing perturbations is comparable to the growth rate of errors deduced from large numerical models of the atmosphere. The Rossby wave motion together with amplifying perturbations possesses jet-like features not found in Rossby wave motion alone. It is suggested that barotropic instability is largely responsible for the unpredictability of the real atmosphere.},

They appear as leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of 500-hPa height or 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies and are found from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. Both patterns exhibit wave 3 hemispheric patterns in mid to high latitudes, and a well-defined wave train with large amplitude in the Pacific\textendash South American (PSA) sector. Therefore, they are referred to as the PSA modes (PSA1 and PSA2). PSA1 is related to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the central and eastern Pacific at decadal scales, and it is the response to El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the interannual band. The associated rainfall summer pattern shows rainfall deficits over northeastern Brazil and enhanced rainfall over southeastern South America similar to rainfall anomalies during ENSO. PSA2 is associated with the quasi-biennial component of ENSO, with a period of 22\textendash 28 months and the strongest connections occur during the austral spring. The associated rainfall pattern shows a dipole pattern with anomalies out of phase between the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) extending from central South America into the Atlantic and the subtropical plains centred at 35\textdegree S. These two modes are also apparent in tropical intraseasonal oscillations for both summer and winter. Eastward propagation of enhanced convection from the Indian Ocean through the western Pacific to the central Pacific is accompanied by a wave train that appears to originate in the convective regions. The positive PSA1 pattern is associated with enhanced convection over the Pacific from 150\textdegree E to the date line. The convection pattern associated with PSA2 is in quadrature with that of PSA1. Both PSA modes are influenced by the Madden Julian Oscillation and influence rainfall over South America.

Singular value decomposition (SVD) of September\textendash November sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies reveals patterns of El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific and the IOD in the equatorial Indian Ocean. The relative importance of the IOD's impact on sea ice in the Pacific sector of Antarctica is difficult to assess for two reasons: 1) ENSO generates larger anomalies in the Pacific and Weddell Sea and 2) many of the positive (negative) IODs co-occur with El Ni\~no (La Ni\~na). West of the Ross Sea, sea ice growth can be attributed to the negative heat fluxes associated with cold meridional flow between high and low pressure cells generated by the effects of the IOD. However, the locations of these positive and negative pressure anomaly centers tend to appear north of the sea ice zone during combined ENSO\textendash IOD events, reducing the influence of the IOD on sea ice. The IOD influence is at a maximum in the region west of the Ross Sea. When ENSO is removed, sea ice in the Indian Ocean (near 608E) increases because of cold outflows west of low pressure centers while sea ice near 908E decreases because of the warm advection west of a high pressure center located south of Australia.},

Time scales from synoptic to interannual are investigated, focusing on the means by which tropical variability is communicated to the midlatitudes and on in situ forcing within the midlatitude waveguides. Particular interest is paid to what fraction of the total variability associated with the PSA, occurring on interannual time scales, is attributable to tropical forcing relative to that occurring on synoptic and intraseasonal time scales via internal waveguide dynamics. In general, it is found that the eastward-propagating wave train pattern typically associated with the PSA manifests across time scales from synoptic to interannual, with the majority of the variability occurring on synoptic-to-intraseasonal time scales largely independent of tropical convection. It is found that the small fraction of the total variance with a tropical signal occurs via the zonal component of the thermal wind modulating both the subtropical and polar jets. The respective roles of the Hadley circulation and stationary Rossby wave sources are also examined. Further, a PSA-like mode is identified in terms of the slow components of higher-order modes of tropospheric geopotential height. This study reestablishes the multiscale nonlinear nature of the PSA modes arising largely as a manifestation of internal midlatitude waveguide dynamics and local disturbances.},

  abstract = {In this article, we study the climate link between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the southern sea-ice extent (SIE), and discuss the possible role of stationary waves and synoptic eddies in establishing this link. In doing so, we have used a combination of techniques involving spatial correlations of SIE, eddy streamfunction and wind anomalies, and statistics of high-latitude cyclone strength. It is suggested that stationary waves may be amplified by eddy anomalies associated with high latitude cyclones, resulting in more sea ice when the SAM is in its positive phase for most, but not all, longitudes. A similar association is observed during ENSO (La Ni\~na years). Although this synergy in the SAM/ENSO response may partially reflect preferential areas for wave amplification around Antarctica, the short extent of the climate records does not allow for a definite causality connection to be established with SIE. Stronger polar cyclones are observed over the areas where the stationary waves are amplified. These deeper cyclones will break up and export ice equatorward more efficiently, but the near-coastal regions are cold enough to allow for a rapid re-freeze of the resulting ice break-up. We speculate that if global warming continues this same effect could help reverse the current (positive) Antarctic SIE trends once the ice gets thinner, similarly to what has been observed in the Northern Hemisphere.},

The flux which appears in this relation constitutes, it is argued, a useful diagnostic of the three-dimensional propagation of stationary wave activity. This is illustrated by application to a simple theoretical model of a forced Rossby wave train and to a Northern Hemisphere winter climatology. Results of the latter procedure suggest that the major forcing of the stationary wave field derives from the orographic effects of the Tibetan plateau and from nonorographic effects (diabatic heating and/or interaction with transient eddies) in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans and Siberia. No evidence is found in the data for wave trains of tropical origin; forcing by the orographic effects of the Rocky mountains seems to be of secondary importance.},

The analysis examined land rain and temperature and 3-dimensional atmospheric variables for a 42 yr period from January 1958 to December 1999. The correlation between IOD and the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is accounted for using the multiple regression technique. We used partial correlation coefficients to describe the unique contribution of IOD to climate variability, independent of ENSO. In the Indian Ocean rim countries, IOD is associated with significant temperature and rain variability manifesting 2 large-scale patterns. In one, land temperature and rain are anomalously high over countries west of the Indian Ocean and anomalously low to its east. In the second pattern, enhanced rainfall is found over the Asian monsoon trough, extending from Pakistan up to southern China. Also noted are IOD impacts on several regions remote from the Indian Ocean. Strong correlation is found over Europe, northeast Asia, North and South America and South Africa concurrent with IOD events. Over these regions, positive IOD events are associated with warm land surface anomalies and reduced rainfall. The troposphere above the Indian Ocean exhibits strong variability during IOD events characterized by the following structures: (1) a Walker cell anomaly over the equator; (2) a deep modulation of monsoon westerlies; and (3) a Hadley cell anomaly over the Bay of Bengal. In the extratropics, IOD is associated with equivalent barotropic geopotential anomalies. These assume annular structure in the northern hemisphere, but Rossby wave train structure in the southern hemisphere.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional dynamical chemical model of the middle atmosphere is used to examine the global response to planetary waves in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The model indicates that larger wave activity in the lower stratosphere at 60\textdegree N is correlated with decreasing zonal mean temperatures throughout the tropical and summer hemisphere stratosphere as a result of an induced global-scale circulation. The tendency of mean ozone is positively correlated with the temperature tendency in the lower stratosphere and negatively correlated in the upper stratosphere. In the upper stratosphere, the anticorrelation of mean ozone and temperature is due primarily to the temperature dependence of many of the reaction rates. The quantitative agreement of the model results with available observations is better when the dependence of the ozone-temperature relation on the mean ozone amount is removed (by taking the log of ozone) because the model ozone differs from the observed. A model run in which the atmospheric chlorine is removed indicates that the magnitude of the ozone change for a given temperature change can be substantial for modifications in the model photochemistry. Another run tested a more realistic change in which a key reaction rate is modified; the results indicate differences of greater than 10\% in the ratio of ozone to temperature changes. With improved measurement capabilities differences of this order may now or soon be detectable. The variations of other chemical species in the model with temperature are also presented.},

It is shown that, when a warming event occurs in the equatorial eastern Pacific (EP El Ni\~no), there is a negative sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly in the eastern Pacific and a positive one in the western Pacific. Besides, there exists a negative anomaly between 40\textdegree S and 60\textdegree S and a positive anomaly to the south of 60\textdegree S. When a warming event in the central Pacific (CP El Ni\~no) occurs, there appears a negative SLP anomaly in the central Pacific and a positive SLP anomaly in the eastern and western Pacific, but the SLP anomalies are not so evident in the SH extratropics. In particular, the Pacific-South America (PSA) pattern induced by the CP El Ni\~no is located more northwestward, with a weaker anomaly compared with the EP El Ni\~no. This difference is directly related with the different position of heating centers associated with the two types of El Ni\~no events. Because the SST anomaly associated with CP El Ni\~no is located more westward than that associated with EP El Ni\~no, the related heating center tends to move westward and the response of SH atmospheric circulation to the tropical heating changes accordingly, thus exciting a different position of the PSA pattern. It is also noted that the local meridional cell plays a role in the SH high latitudes during EP El Ni\~no. The anomalous ascending motion due to the enhancement of convection over the eastern Pacific leads to an enhancement of the local Hadley cell and the meridional cell in the middle and high latitudes, which in turn induces an anomalous descending motion and the related positive anomaly of geopotential height over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea.},

The analysis is based upon daily height fields at 1000 and 500 mb for both summer and winter. Histogram frequency distributions of height anomalies and maps of the skewness and kurtosis have been computed. Blocking events are objectively defined by requiring a large positive anomaly to exist for 5 days or more. Composite flow and anomaly fields for several cases are presented and examined in detail. The geographical distribution of the frequency of lame amplitude {$\geqslant$}150 gpm anomalies at 500 mb that persist for only 1\textendash 3 days is very similar to that of the high-frequency band (2\textendash 8 day period) variances that identity the storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere. The primary location for blocking in the Southern Hemisphere is in the New Zealand sector and blocking occurs through a local enhancement of the climatological split in the mean westerlies on a spatial scale of 60\textdegree{} longitude. Other maxima occur southeast of South America and over the southern Indian Ocean. Sporadically, multiple blocking events occur at more than one location and one triple blocking event is examined in detail. Zonal wave 3 is strongly evident in such cases; it also plays a dominant role in the majority of blocking events. However, on most occasions, blocking occurs in isolation as a local phenomenon, and it appears that the local wave 3 may be but part of a wave train with a great circle rather than zonal orientation. Transient eddies appear to play an important role in sustaining a blocking event by either continually reinforcing the anticyclone on its western flank or by quickly reestablishing a new anticyclone as the old one breaks down or moves away.},

The effects of tropical and extra-tropical forcing factors on the phase and amplitude of the planetary waves are identified. The amplitudes of wave numbers 1\textendash 3 exhibit an annual cycle with a minimum in summer and maximum over the extended austral winter period. The phase of wave number 1 has a semi-annual cycle, moving east in austral spring/autumn and west in summer/winter as a result of differences in the phase of the semi-annual oscillation across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The phase of wave number 3 has an annual cycle, being more eastward (westward) in summer (winter). Year-to-year variability of the amplitude of wave number 1 is found to be strongly associated with the Amundsen Sea Low, which in turn is known to be strongly influenced by the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, with the consequence that the amplitude of wave number 1 is larger during the El Ni\~no phase of the cycle. Regarding trends for the year as a whole, the amplitude of wave number 1 has decreased since 1979 (p {$<$} 0.1), while the amplitudes of wave numbers 2 and 3 have increased.

  abstract = {The positive phase of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) increases global mean temperature and contributes to a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant mode of climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere. This interannual relationship of a high global mean temperature associated with a negative SAM, however, is opposite to the relationship between their trends under greenhouse warming. We show that over much of the 20th century this relationship undergoes multidecadal fluctuations depending on the intensity of ENSO. During the period 1925\textendash 1955, subdued ENSO activities weakened the relationship. However, a similar weakening has occurred since the late 1970s despite the strong ENSO. We demonstrate that this recent weakening is induced by climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. Our result highlights a rare situation in which climate change signals emerge against an opposing property of interannual variability, underscoring the robustness of the recent climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a huge influence on Antarctic climate variability via Rossby wave trains. In this study, the asymmetry of the ENSO teleconnection in the Southern Hemisphere, as along with the mechanisms involved, is systematically investigated. In four reanalysis datasets, the composite atmospheric circulation anomaly in austral winter over the Amundsen Sea during La Ni\~na is situated more to the west than during El Ni\~no. This asymmetric feature is reproduced by ECHAM5.3.2 forced with both composite and idealized symmetric sea surface temperature anomalies. Utilizing a linear baroclinic model, we find that ENSO-triggered circulation anomalies in the subtropics can readily extract kinetic energy from the climatological mean flow and develop efficiently at the exit of the subtropical jet stream (STJ). The discrepancy in the location of the STJ between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na causes asymmetric circulation responses by affecting the energy conversion. During El Ni\~no years, anomalous tropical convective precipitation increases the meridional temperature gradient, which in turn leads to the strengthening of the STJ and the eastward movement of the jet core and jet exit in the Pacific. With the movement of the STJ exit, the wave train tends to develop over the eastern region. The opposite is the case during La Ni\~na when the westward shift of the jet exit favors the development of the wave train in the western region. Our findings expand the current understanding regarding ENSO teleconnection.},

Correctly interpreting results of multiple simultaneous tests requires a higher standard of evidence than is the case when evaluating results of a single test, and this has been known in the atmospheric sciences literature for more than a century. Even so, the issue continues to be widely ignored, leading routinely to overstatement and overinterpretation of scientific results, to the detriment of the discipline.

  abstract = {Abstract Two El Ni\~no flavors have been defined based on whether warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are located in the central or eastern tropical Pacific (CP or EP). This study further characterizes the impacts on atmospheric circulation in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere associated with these types of El Ni\~no events though a series of numerical simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). Comparing results with the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), CAM simulates well the known changes to blocking over Australia and a southward shift in the subtropical jet stream across the eastern Pacific basin during CP events. More importantly for the high southern latitudes, CAM simulates a westward shift in upper-level divergence in the tropical Pacific, which causes the Pacific\textendash South American stationary wave pattern to shift toward the west across the entire South Pacific. These changes to the Rossby wave source region impact the South Pacific convergence zone and jet streams and weaken the high-latitude blocking that is typically present in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas during EP events. Anticyclonic flow becomes established farther west in the south central Pacific, modifying high-latitude heat and momentum fluxes across the South Pacific and South Atlantic associated with the ENSO\textendash Antarctic dipole.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerical simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) are conducted based on tropical forcing of El Ni\~no flavors. Though these events occur on a continuum, two general types are simulated based on sea surface temperature anomalies located in the central (CP) or eastern (EP) tropical Pacific. The goal is to assess whether CAM adequately represents the transient eddy dynamics associated with each of these El Ni\~no flavors under different southern annular mode (SAM) regimes. CAM captures well the wide spatial and temporal variability associated with the SAM but only accurately simulates the impacts on atmospheric circulation in the high southern latitudes when the observed SAM phase is matched by the model. Composites of in-phase (El Ni\~no\textendash SAM-) and out-of-phase (El Ni\~no\textendash SAM+) events confirm a seasonal preference for in-phase (out of phase) events during December\textendash February (DJF) [June\textendash August (JJA)]. Modeled in-phase events for both EP (during DJF) and CP (during JJA) conditions support observations of anomalous equatorward momentum flux on the equatorward side of the eddy-driven jet, shifting this jet equatorward and consistent with the low phase of the SAM. Out-of-phase composites show that the El Ni\~no\textendash associated teleconnection to the high southern latitudes is strongly modulated by the SAM, as a strong eddy-driven jet is well maintained by high-latitude transient eddy convergence despite the tropical forcing. A regional perspective confirms that this interaction takes place primarily over the Pacific Ocean, with high-latitude circulation variability being a product of both tropical and high-latitude forcing.},

  abstract = {Hemispheric maps of monthly mean total ozone display distinct waves of low zonal wavenumbers during winter months. In addition, there is a strong and statistically significant spatial correlation between the total ozone perturbation and the temperature perturbation in the lower stratosphere. Previous attempts at an explanation of the correlation appear somewhat unsatisfactory. In the current paper the climatological behavior for southern hemisphere October is investigated. Specifying the dynamics from observations in the linearized stationary ozone continuity equation, one can simulate the lowest wavenumbers of the hemispheric total ozone perturbation. Both vertical and horizontal advection substantially contribute to the total ozone perturbation, with significantly different patterns each. A conceptual picture for the correlation is developed, which accounts for both advection contributions. The slopes of lower stratospheric zonal mean potential temperature and ozone mixing ratio turn out to be important. Furthermore, the feasibility of a Matsuno-type model for the waves in total ozone is shown.},

  abstract = {This study uncovers an early 1990s change in the relationships between El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and two leading modes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmospheric variability: the southern annular mode (SAM) and the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern. During austral spring, while the PSA maintained a strong correlation with ENSO throughout the period 1948-2014, the SAM-ENSO correlation changed from being weak before the early 1990s to being strong afterward. Through the ENSO connection, PSA and SAM became more in-phase correlated after the early 1990s. The early 1990s is also the time when ENSO changed from being dominated by the eastern Pacific (EP) type to being dominated by the central Pacific (CP) type. Analyses show that, while the EP ENSO can excite only the PSA, the CP ENSO can excite both the SAM and PSA through tropospheric and stratospheric pathway mechanisms. The more in-phase relationship between SAM and PSA impacted the post-1990s Antarctic climate in at least two aspects: 1) a stronger Antarctic sea ice dipole structure around the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas due to intensified geopotential height anomalies over the region and 2) a shift in the phase relationships of surface air temperature anomalies among East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula. These findings imply that ENSO-Antarctic climate relations depend on the dominant ENSO type and that ENSO forcing has become more important to the Antarctic sea ice and surface air temperature variability in the past two decades and will in the coming decades if the dominance of CP ENSO persists.},
